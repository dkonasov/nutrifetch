# Nutrifetch

## What is it about

This is my first Vue pet-project, which helps me to get into some basics of this framework. Its features are dedicated to food nutritients analysis. Perfoming such analysis may help people to make decisions on their diet based on their current needs.

## Implemented features

Currently there is only one feature in this app: a list of foods with some basic nutritiens: fats, carbs, proteins and energy data. It support two-steps sorting: first step allows user to get top 20 items based on first parameter, and second step sorts this list by another factor. For example, you can retrieve 20 items with the highest protein values, and then order them by fats, from low to high.
